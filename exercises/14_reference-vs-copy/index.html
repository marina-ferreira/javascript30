    // Let's say we have an array

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Marina';
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem: we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    let team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Marina';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let captain = person;

    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 104 })
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // deep clone - not best choice
    let captain3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(captain));
    captain3.name = 'Marina';
